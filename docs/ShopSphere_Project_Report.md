- **Backend/API:** Next.js API routes, MySQL2, dotenv, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt
- **Database:** MySQL (accessed via MySQL2)
- **State Management:** React Context API for cart and authentication
- **Folder Structure:**
  - `src/app/` — Main app pages and layouts
  - `src/components/` — UI and layout components
  - `src/context/` — Global state providers
  - `src/hooks/` — Custom React hooks
  - `src/lib/` — Utilities, types, and DB helpers
  - `src/pages/api/` — REST API endpoints
  - `public/` — Static assets
  - `services/` — External integrations (e.g., payment)

## 5. Technologies Used
- Next.js, React, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Lucide React
- MySQL2, dotenv, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt
- Zod, React Hook Form

## 6. Security Considerations
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage.
- JWT is used for secure authentication and session management.
- Sensitive configuration is managed via environment variables.
- API endpoints validate and sanitize input data.
